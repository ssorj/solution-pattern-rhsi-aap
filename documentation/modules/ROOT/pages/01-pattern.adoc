== The story behind this solution pattern

{aap} (AAP) is widely used to manage a variety of environments.
In many cases, a central AAP instance can be used to provide automation to multiple,
distinct customers, referred to in this solution pattern as third-party networks.

The organizations behind these third-party networks are independent, and they need their internal
networks to remain secure and isolated from the public internet.
However, they also need to allow a centralized AAP instance, owned by a trusted partner, to be able to maintain
their server's infrastructure.

These organizations need an easy way to expose their target servers to be managed by the trusted partner,
and they do not want to allocate extra resources to change their network infrastructure.

== The Solution

With *{rhsi}* version 2, they can achieve this with minimal effort, due to its
declarative nature.

The trusted partner that uses *{aap}* (AAP) to manage the resources of the third-party networks
has its AAP instance running on an OpenShift cluster in the public cloud.

The trusted partner also prepares a {rhsi} site bundle to be installed on the third-party
infrastructure, exposing their target servers to a specific namespace within their OpenShift cluster.
A dedicated namespace is used for each third-party network, so that they're isolated from other namespaces,
being accessible only to the *`aap`* namespace where the AAP instance is running.

With that, AAP can manage the third-party servers while keeping their hosts and network protected, since all the
traffic coming from AAP into their network will flow through {rhsi}, using secured mutual
TLS authentication and encryption.

Managing hosts within a third-party network using *{aap}* (AAP) can present unique challenges
due to security restrictions and several other obstacles, like strict policies that do not allow incoming connections to be
established.

Additionally, setting up a VPN connection can introduce further complexities for organizations that are already dealing with
complex IT environments. Many companies prefer to avoid the added administrative overhead associated with VPN.

This solution pattern introduces a secure, flexible and easy alternative to expose desired hosts running in protected
environments, to be managed remotely by AAP using *{rhsi}*.

== Use cases

Common use cases that can be address with this architecture are:

- Extend your Ansible automation to reach hosts on private networks
- Exposing TCP workloads accessible by a Linux or a Container endpoint, into a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
- Access workloads running on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster as a local endpoint in your internal network

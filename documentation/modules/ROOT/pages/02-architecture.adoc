[#in_depth]
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

The trusted partner has a *{ocp}* cluster running on the public cloud. In this {ocp} cluster, they
have a **{aap}** (AAP) instance used to manage third-party resources.

This AAP instance runs inside the `*aap*` namespace. In order for their AAP instance to communicate with
third-party servers, whicy are not accessible from the public cloud, they use *{rhsi}* (RHSI) version 2.

A dedicated namespace is created for each isolated third-party network.

Network policies are applied to the third-party namespaces to ensure that incoming internal traffic is allowed only 
from the `*aap*` namespace. This ensures that unauthorized access from a separate third-party namespace,
as well as from any other namespace within this OpenShift cluster, is denied.

Each third-party namespace has an instance of {rhsi} (RHSI), and this instance is responsible for receiving an incoming
RHSI link, coming from the third-party network. Once the mutual TLS link is established, a selected set of servers
from the third-party network ares exposed by an RHSI instance running
within the third-party network, into the third-party specific namespace on the {ocp} cluster.

The respective servers are then exposed as Kubernetes services within the third-party namespace, where the AAP instance
is able to communicate with them via SSH transparently through RHSI.

Distinct inventories ared created inside AAP, one for each third-party network, representing the servers to be managed.

=== Alternative architecture

Consider an alternative and illustrative architecture, for scenarios where the {aap} instance, used by the Trusted Partner,
is not hosted in a Public Cloud environment.

By introducing an intermediary site within a public cloud, we can seamlessly integrate private networks.
This approach involves deploying another {ocp} cluster in the public cloud, with dedicated namespaces for each
third-party network. These namespaces have their own {rhsi} instance to provide secure and isolated endpoints for incoming
links from both the trusted-partner network and the third-party networks.

While this alternative approach is not the focus of this solution pattern, it highlights the flexibility and
adaptability of our solution to diverse network environments. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, we can empower
organizations to achieve optimal performance, security, and scalability.

== About the Technology Stack

{rhsi} provides access to selected workloads running in the third-party network.
In this solution pattern, we illustrate two third-party networks being managed by AAP.
One of them, represented as *_Third-party network A_* has an RHSI instance running on a *{rhel}* (RHEL) machine.

The following one, represented as *_Third-party network B_* has an RHSI instance running using *Podman*.

It is important to mention that {rhsi} (version 2+) runs on Kubernetes clusters,
{rhel}, and using Podman or Docker container engines.
